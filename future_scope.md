# Future Scope and Improvement Report: Essay Scoring Toolkit

## 1. Current Capabilities (as of May 2025)

The essay scoring toolkit implements a modular, extensible architecture for automated essay evaluation. The following strategies and features are currently present:

### Core Implemented Strategies
- **Classical Text Similarity**: Levenshtein, Jaccard, BLEU, BM25, TF-IDF, and related metrics via `SimilarityCalculator`.
- **Semantic Similarity**: Sentence Transformers (BERT-based) for deep semantic matching (`SemanticCosineSimilarity`).
- **AMR Similarity**: Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing and Smatch scoring (`AMRSimilarityCalculator`).
- **Keyword Matching**: Coverage and vocabulary cosine similarity (`KeywordMatcher`).
- **POS-based Similarity**: Pattern overlap and comparison (`score_pos`).
- **Advanced Features**: Graph-based similarity, plagiarism detection (Smith-Waterman, k-gram), clustering (TF-IDF, hierarchical, silhouette), and character-level metrics.
- **Coreference Resolution**: Rule-based system using spaCy.
- **Readability Analysis**: (in `readbility.py`) for stylistic and complexity features.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization, lemmatization, tokenization, etc.
- **Configuration/Logging**: Pydantic models, YAML/.env support, and rich logging.

## 2. Combined/Integrated Features
- All major metrics are orchestrated in `score_essay`, with results aggregated into a unified `EssayScores` model.
- Modular design allows independent testing and extension of each metric.
- Batch/corpus analysis and per-student reporting are supported in `text_features.py`.

## 3. Missing or Partially Implemented Features
- **AMR Feature Expansion**: Placeholders for frame similarity, SRL similarity, reentrancy, degree, quantifier, and walk similarity are present but not implemented.
- **Semantic Graph Similarity**: spaCy-based semantic graph similarity is commented out or incomplete.
- **SRL (Semantic Role Labeling) Similarity**: Code is present but commented out; not integrated into scoring pipeline.
- **Human Scoring Alignment**: No direct calibration or regression to human scores; no learning-to-rank or supervised calibration.
- **Explainability**: No explicit feature attribution or explainable AI (XAI) modules.
- **Feedback Generation**: No automated feedback or suggestions for student improvement.
- **Multilingual Support**: English-only; no support for other languages or code-switching.
- **Robustness to Adversarial Inputs**: No explicit adversarial or robustness testing.
- **UI/UX**: No web or GUI interface; CLI and script-based only.
- **Integration with LMS**: No direct integration with learning management systems (LMS).
- **Model/Metric Selection**: No dynamic selection or weighting of metrics based on prompt or essay type.
- **Data Augmentation**: No synthetic data generation for rare/edge cases.
- **Bias/Fairness Auditing**: No bias detection or fairness metrics.

## 4. Recommendations & Future Directions

### a. **Feature Expansion**
- Implement the missing AMR features (frame, SRL, reentrancy, etc.) for deeper semantic analysis.
- Activate and validate spaCy-based semantic graph similarity and SRL modules.
- Add more advanced plagiarism detection (e.g., paraphrase detection, cross-document analysis).
- Integrate readability and stylistic features into the main scoring pipeline.

### b. **Machine Learning & Calibration**
- Add supervised learning (regression/classification) to calibrate scores to human ratings.
- Explore learning-to-rank, ensemble, or meta-models to combine metrics optimally.
- Collect and use human-graded essays for model training and validation.

### c. **Explainability & Feedback**
- Implement feature attribution (e.g., SHAP, LIME) for explainable scoring.
- Generate actionable feedback for students (e.g., missing key points, grammar suggestions).

### d. **Robustness, Fairness, and Ethics**
- Add adversarial testing (e.g., nonsense, memorized, or off-topic essays).
- Audit for bias and fairness across demographic groups.
- Provide transparency on model limitations and confidence.

### e. **Usability & Integration**
- Develop a web-based or GUI interface for broader accessibility.
- Integrate with LMS platforms (e.g., Moodle, Canvas) for real-world deployment.
- Add API endpoints for programmatic access.

### f. **Multilingual and Multimodal Support**
- Extend to other languages and code-mixed essays.
- Explore multimodal scoring (e.g., essays with images, tables).

### g. **Continuous Improvement**
- Set up automated evaluation pipelines and benchmarks.
- Collect user feedback and error cases for iterative improvement.
